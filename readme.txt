NutsForPress Duplicate Any Posts is the perfect solution for duplicating post, the ones created with Elementor too


== Description ==

*Duplicate Any Posts* is one of the several NutsForPress plugins providing some essential features that WordPress does not offer itself or offers only partially.  

*Duplicate Any Posts* allows you to:

* decide which post or custom post should be duplicable
* duplicate page or posts into post/page list, by clicking on the duplicate link below the post/page title

If you duplicate a post or a page built with Elementor, after the duplication you have to open the duplicated post/page with the Elementor editor and save.

Duplicate Any Posts is full compliant with WPML (you don't need to translate any option value)
